MYPortfolio

Project time: 1 week.
Technigo Bootcamp
This is my portfolio! 
I think I have provided a good foundation to continue building on. I think I have become more confident in html and css and I am glad that my header worked with the javascript code I found when I was looking for inspiration.
I had some problems with the picture stretching out in Safari, but apparently it is a bug in flexbox with Safari where default is stretch. So I solved it with flex-start.
